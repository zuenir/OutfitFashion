## ðŸ”– About

The UI app is based on the Outfitr - Fashion UI Kit from Flexin Studio (https://gumroad.com/l/sfEm). Where I'm using different react native packages which is useful for creating any kind of app. Based on @William Candillon's youtube series "Can it be done in React Native"?.

I continued building the layout, made some changes, added new screens. It was a very rewarding season as a front-end developer. "Happy Hacking". Thank you so much @William Candillon.
